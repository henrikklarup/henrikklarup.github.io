I've started blogging...

This blog is going to be about what I am doing in my professional life, but also a bit personal as the two are always intertwined.

This first blog post is going to be a short intro into who I am.

So my name is Henrik Klarup, I was born in a small town in the northern part of Denmark, called Sæby. It's about 24 years since i popped into the world ready to live and enjoy life.

For the first ~19 years I lived with my parents and sisters in Sæby, but when I started University in Aalborg I moved my address a little closer.

For the past ~5 years I've been studying Software Engineering at Aalborg University, and this year I am finally going to get my masters done, and start living the real working life that is adulthood.

Though the past 6 months I've been involved in an entrepreneurial startup project where, together with a friend, I am developing a platform for visualizing fish auction prices.
This process have been really fun to be a part of, and I am looking forward to whatever comes next, seeking investors and so on.

I've managed to couple my project and my master thesis together and I am going to write about "How can we systematically use feedback in the team, and with the surroundings to ensure harmony between product, vision, and business model".

This is just a brief summary of what I am currently doing.

Keep happy and remember to smile
